# Basic observation on LeNet

Observe network variable by `get_activation_info` and `get_weight_info`.

In the interactive Python program below, we obtain these information of each layer in LeNet:

1. Shape of weights and activaitons
1. Min/Max range of weights and activations
1. Standard deviation of weights and activations
1. Samping data and visualize its distribution
1. Visualize its feature map
